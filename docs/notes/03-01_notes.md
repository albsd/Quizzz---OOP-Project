everyone present
HCI due this friday (deadline extended to midnight)

feedback HCI:
- reference nielsons heuristics and other general info we got from HCI lectures
- reporting is sufficient
- could ask friends for new feedback
- document should be time-independant (better labels for the experience of the reviewers)
- Not a lot of mentions on how the experiment was run
- try to add more reflection on why the problems are problems
- more details on how improvements were made in the reflection (add updated UI)

next week buddycheck (DON'T MISS DEADLINE)
sprints: look over all unassigned issues, see if they're feasible in 1 sprint
assign week 4 issues (or week 5)
add checkstyles to CoC
test coverage doesn't need to be 100%
need general document on how you test UI
we don't need to do anything regarding 'mocking'
add activity data to repo (20 total)
no meeting next week (optionally)
decide on meeting time next week
monday all day or tuesday afternoon
